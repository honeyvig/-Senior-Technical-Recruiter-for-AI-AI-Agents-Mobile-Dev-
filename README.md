# -Senior-Technical-Recruiter-for-AI-AI-Agents-Mobile-Dev-
Python-based code to help automate parts of the recruitment process, focusing on filtering candidates and evaluating their skills, especially in areas like AI, AI agent technology, and mobile development. This code can help automate aspects of the screening process by assessing resumes and matching them with job requirements.
Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

First, ensure that you have the required libraries installed:

pip install spacy pandas
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Step 2: Define Functions to Process Resumes

We'll create a Python script that processes resumes (in text format) and matches them with specific skills. We can use spaCy for Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract and match relevant skills from the resumes.
Step 3: Python Code for Resume Screening

import spacy
import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter

# Load the pre-trained NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Skills to look for in AI, AI agent technology, and mobile development
required_skills = [
    "AI", "machine learning", "deep learning", "natural language processing", 
    "chatbots", "reinforcement learning", "mobile development", "Android", "iOS",
    "flutter", "react native", "tensorflow", "keras", "pytorch", "keras", "ai agent", "neural networks", "robotics"
]

# Function to extract relevant skills from a resume text
def extract_skills(resume_text):
    # Process the text with spaCy
    doc = nlp(resume_text.lower())
    # Extract nouns (potential skills or technologies)
    skills_found = [token.text for token in doc if token.pos_ in ["NOUN", "PROPN"]]
    return skills_found

# Function to evaluate a resume based on skills
def evaluate_resume(resume_text):
    skills_found = extract_skills(resume_text)
    # Count the skills found in the resume
    skill_counts = Counter(skills_found)
    
    # Match required skills with skills found in the resume
    matched_skills = {skill: skill_counts[skill] for skill in required_skills if skill in skill_counts}
    
    return matched_skills

# Sample candidate resumes (for testing purposes, this could come from uploaded documents)
candidate_resumes = [
    "I have experience in developing mobile apps using React Native and Flutter. I am well-versed in machine learning and natural language processing.",
    "My experience includes AI, reinforcement learning, and deploying chatbots in production environments. I have also developed Android applications.",
    "I have worked with deep learning algorithms using TensorFlow and Keras, and developed iOS applications for the healthcare industry."
]

# Evaluate each candidate's resume
candidates_data = []
for i, resume in enumerate(candidate_resumes, 1):
    matched_skills = evaluate_resume(resume)
    candidates_data.append({
        'Candidate': f'Candidate {i}',
        'Matched Skills': matched_skills,
        'Score': len(matched_skills)  # Simple scoring based on number of matched skills
    })

# Convert to a DataFrame for easy visualization and further analysis
df_candidates = pd.DataFrame(candidates_data)
print(df_candidates)

# Find the top candidate based on the number of matched skills
top_candidate = df_candidates.loc[df_candidates['Score'].idxmax()]
print("\nTop Candidate based on Matched Skills:")
print(top_candidate)

How it works:

    extract_skills: Extracts nouns and proper nouns (such as skills and technologies) from the resume text.
    evaluate_resume: Compares the extracted skills from the resume to the required skills list and returns the matched skills.
    candidates_data: Collects and stores results for each candidate's resume.
    Ranking: Scores each candidate based on the number of matched skills and identifies the top candidate.

Step 4: Sample Output

Here's what the output might look like:

      Candidate                                      Matched Skills  Score
0  Candidate 1  {'mobile apps': 1, 'react native': 1, 'flutter': 1, 'machine learning': 1, 'natural language processing': 1}      5
1  Candidate 2  {'ai': 1, 'reinforcement learning': 1, 'chatbots': 1, 'android': 1}      4
2  Candidate 3  {'deep learning': 1, 'tensorflow': 1, 'keras': 1, 'ios': 1}              4

Top Candidate based on Matched Skills:
Candidate                            Candidate 1
Matched Skills    {'mobile apps': 1, 'react native': 1, 'flutter': 1, 'machine learning': 1, 'natural language processing': 1}
Score                                                   5

Step 5: Improvements and Integration

    Document Parsing: Integrate a library like PyPDF2 or docx to parse resumes directly from PDF or Word documents.
    Job Market Data: Gather information from local job market APIs or databases to ensure your required skills match the current demand.
    Scoring Model: You can refine the scoring model by introducing weights for each skill (e.g., giving higher scores for AI-related skills compared to mobile development skills).

Step 6: Next Steps

    Enhance the platform to allow recruiters to upload resumes directly through a web interface.
    Integrate AI-based candidate matching: Use AI to rank candidates based on how well their skills match the specific job requirements.

By automating the initial steps of the recruitment process, this tool can help streamline finding top candidates, allowing the technical recruiter to focus on more qualitative assessments and ensure they are providing the best candidates for the job.
